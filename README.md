# **Request Machine app**

A website to compare Software requirements to Laptop abilities. Both lists can be updated and then the laptop list can be narrowed down automatically by choosing one or more software with their requirements . The app works best on desktop machines, but can be used on tablets in landscape mode too.

## UX design

The design primarily focus on simplicity and usability to provide a good user experience while giving feedback to the user by colour changes on the navigation bar.

The goal was not to provide a cross platform tool to all devices, but to show, how to retrive data and combine with other data sets from mongo db, and give a possible start point to corporate request app, where the employee can request a laptop based on their needs. 

The split navigation bars show the main difference between the parts of the tool given to the administrators and the users.
